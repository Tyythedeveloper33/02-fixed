# Accessibility Markup

## A fully functional started code with adjusted accesibility

This project is an example of a starter code that was  fully  functional besides one of the navigational links, I went ahead and cleaned up The code with semantic HTML elements,giving alt attributes to the pictures,curing contrast, that might be hard to read for users with poor vision  that were nested in the Aside bar. Also cleaning up the CSS making it easier to navigate through, by giving comments, and deleting code that may have been repeated and givng it a more friendly vibe !

* I find semantic HTML elements when viewing the source code
* The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning when viewing the structure of HTML elements
* will find accessible alt attributes when viewing icon and image elements
* heading attributes fall in sequential order
* WHEN viewing the title element,will find a concise, descriptive title

## How to use this example accessibility on your future projects
Since this is a starter code someone else developed I would not recomend  just copy and this code and using it as is, the best way i can see this being help to people is to use this project as a reference to look at when it comes to certain accesibility functions and how to make your project accessible to all users!

I also found a tool that might be useful to alot of users struggling on where to start to make accesibility changes to their website that will be posted below, as of right now I know that it is able for use for Mac and Window users, so go ahead and install it to your extensions!

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
